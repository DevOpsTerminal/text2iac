# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### 1. API Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
- Main entry point for all client requests
- Handles authentication and request validation
- Orchestrates communication between services
- Manages template generation and deployment

### 2. Email Bridge Service (Python)
- Monitors email inbox for new requests
- Processes incoming emails and extracts requirements
- Forwards requests to API service
- Sends status updates via email

### 3. Frontend (React)
- Web interface for interacting with the platform
- Form for submitting IaC generation requests
- Dashboard for monitoring deployments

### 4. Template Repository
- Collection of reusable IaC templates
- Organized by cloud provider and service type
- Version controlled and tested

## Data Flow

1. User submits request via Web UI or Email
2. Request is validated and processed by API service
3. LLM generates appropriate IaC configuration
4. Configuration is validated and stored
5. Deployment is initiated (if requested)
6. Status updates are sent back to the user

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting and request validation in place
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Scalability

- Stateless services for horizontal scaling
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Monitoring and auto-scaling based on load
